\noindent{I want to express my deepest gratitude and appreciation to my exceptional supervisor, Francisco M. Couto, for his invaluable guidance, support, and expertise throughout the completion of my thesis. 
I also want to thank André Lamúrias for acting as a non-official co-supervisor. His suggestions and expertise in the field were crucial for developing this thesis. 
To my day-to-day LASIGE colleagues (Vinícius, Márcia, Sofia, Pedro R., Pedro B., Allan, Jéssica, Nuno, Tiago, Rúben, and Paulo) and ex-colleagues (Telma, Miguel, Dharmite, Ricardo, Carlota, and Lobna), for coffee, lunch, and for all the excellent team spirit and working environment. To the true powerhouses of LASIGE, Alexandra and Carla, amazing people without whom nobody could achieve anything in the office.
To my Scottish colleagues turned friends Thomas, Hitarth, Jack, and Javier for the best welcome and guidance through the Glaswegian way of life. To Jake Lever for his willingness to take me in and guide me through my work at the University of Glasgow. 
To Rita, the most amazing friend and colleague, my doctoral sister, and without a doubt, the best supporter I could ever hope for during this time in my life. The thousands of hours spent together propelled me forward during these years, never letting me feel alone in this endeavour, and I could not ask for a better companion in my PhD journey. 
To my friends Chalupas Rita, Robin$^\star$, Nuno, and \textcolor{violet}{João} for all the day-to-day conversations, forced bouldering lessons, gym weight-ins followed by croissants, and, primarily, group focus towards the doctoral finish line.  
To my friends Pinelenses Beatriz, Sofia, Fernando, and André for being present every step of the way in incredible vacations, dinners, and memorable celebrations of all our successes. 
I also want to thank my parents for allowing me to have all these fantastic opportunities and believing in me always with unconditional support in whatever path I decided to take. To my sister Catarina for forever having my back and inspiring me with determination and perseverance. To Luna for being Luna. Finally, I would like to thank my home, Rafael, for his unconditional love, support, and all the dancing in the middle of the day.}

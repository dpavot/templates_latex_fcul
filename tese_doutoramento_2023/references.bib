    abstract = "With the increasing number of publications about COVID-19, it is a challenge to extract personalized knowledge suitable for each researcher. This work aims to build a new semantic-based pipeline for recommending biomedical entities to scientific researchers. To this end, we developed a pipeline that creates an implicit feedback matrix based on Named Entity Recognition (NER) on a corpus of documents, using multidisciplinary ontologies for recognizing and linking the entities. Our hypothesis is that by using ontologies from different fields in the NER phase, we can improve the results for state-of-the-art collaborative-filtering recommender systems applied to the dataset created. The tests performed using the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) dataset show that when using four ontologies, the results for precision@k, for example, reach the 80{\%}, whereas when using only one ontology, the results for precision@k drops to 20{\%}, for the same users. Furthermore, the use of multi-fields entities may help in the discovery of new items, even if the researchers do not have items from that field in their set of preferences.",

    abstract = "{Radiology reports describe the results of radiography procedures and have the potential of being a useful source of information which can bring benefits to health care systems around the world. One way to automatically extract information from the reports is by using Text Mining tools. The problem is that these tools are mostly developed for English and reports are usually written in the native language of the radiologist, which is not necessarily English. This creates an obstacle to the sharing of Radiology information between different communities. This work explores the solution of translating the reports to English before applying the Text Mining tools, probing the question of what translation approach should be used. We created MRRAD (Multilingual Radiology Research Articles Dataset), a parallel corpus of Portuguese research articles related to Radiology and a number of alternative translations (human, automatic and semi-automatic) to English. This is a novel corpus which can be used to move forward the research on this topic. Using MRRAD we studied which kind of automatic or semi-automatic translation approach is more effective on the Named-entity recognition task of finding RadLex terms in the English version of the articles. Considering the terms extracted from human translations as our gold standard, we calculated how similar to this standard were the terms extracted using other translations. We found that a completely automatic translation approach using Google leads to F-scores (between 0.861 and 0.868, depending on the extraction approach) similar to the ones obtained through a more expensive semi-automatic translation approach using Unbabel (between 0.862 and 0.870). To better understand the results we also performed a qualitative analysis of the type of errors found in the automatic and semi-automatic translations.Database URL:https://github.com/lasigeBioTM/MRRAD}",

Question Answering (QA) systems enable users to retrieve exact answers for questions posed in natural language.
Objective
This study aims at identifying QA techniques, tools and systems, as well as the metrics and indicators used to measure these approaches for QA systems and also to determine how the relationship between Question Answering and natural language processing is built.
Method
The method adopted was a Systematic Literature Review of studies published from 2000 to 2017.
Results
130 out of 1842 papers have been identified as describing a QA approach developed and evaluated with different techniques.
Conclusion
Question Answering researchers have concentrated their efforts in natural language processing, knowledge base and information retrieval paradigms. Most of the researches focused on open domain. Regarding the metrics used to evaluate the approaches, Precision and Recall are the most addressed.}

    abstract = "Distant supervision is an efficient approach that automatically generates labeled data for relation extraction (RE). Traditional distantly supervised RE systems rely heavily on handcrafted features, and hence suffer from error propagation. Recently, a neural network architecture has been proposed to automatically extract features for relation classification. However, this approach follows the traditional expressed-at-least-once assumption, and fails to make full use of information across different sentences. Moreover, it ignores the fact that there can be multiple relations holding between the same entity pair. In this paper, we propose a multi-instance multi-label convolutional neural network for distantly supervised RE. It first relaxes the expressed-at-least-once assumption, and employs cross-sentence max-pooling so as to enable information sharing across different sentences. Then it handles overlapping relations by multi-label learning with a neural network classifier. Experimental results show that our approach performs significantly and consistently better than state-of-the-art methods.",

Our word vectors are learned functions of the internal states of a deep bidirectional language model (biLM), which is pre-trained on a large text corpus. We show that these representations can be easily added to existing models and significantly improve the state of the art across six challenging NLP problems, including question answering, textual entailment and sentiment analysis. We also present an analysis showing that exposing the deep internals of the pre-trained network is crucial, allowing downstream models to mix different types of semi-supervision signals.",

abstract = {Open Information Extraction (IE) is the task of extracting assertions from massive corpora without requiring a pre-specified vocabulary. This paper shows that the output of state-of-the-art Open IE systems is rife with uninformative and incoherent extractions. To overcome these problems, we introduce two simple syntactic and lexical constraints on binary relations expressed by verbs. We implemented the constraints in the ReVerb Open IE system, which more than doubles the area under the precision-recall curve relative to previous extractors such as TextRunner and woepos. More than 30\% of ReVerb's extractions are at precision 0.8 or higher---compared to virtually none for earlier systems. The paper concludes with a detailed analysis of ReVerb's errors, suggesting directions for future work.},

abstract = {We propose ClausIE, a novel, clause-based approach to open information extraction, which extracts relations and their arguments from natural language text. ClausIE fundamentally differs from previous approaches in that it separates the detection of ``useful'' pieces of information expressed in a sentence from their representation in terms of extractions. In more detail, ClausIE exploits linguistic knowledge about the grammar of the English language to first detect clauses in an input sentence and to subsequently identify the type of each clause according to the grammatical function of its constituents. Based on this information, ClausIE is able to generate high-precision extractions; the representation of these extractions can be flexibly customized to the underlying application. ClausIE is based on dependency parsing and a small set of domain-independent lexica, operates sentence by sentence without any post-processing, and requires no training data (whether labeled or unlabeled). Our experimental study on various real-world datasets suggests that ClausIE obtains higher recall and higher precision than existing approaches, both on high-quality text as well as on noisy text as found in the web.},

We use the new, context-sensitive embeddings in a model for predicting prepositional phrase (PP) attachments and jointly learn the concept embeddings and model parameters. We show that using context-sensitive embeddings improves the accuracy of the PP attachment model by 5.4{\%} absolute points, which amounts to a 34.4{\%} relative reduction in errors.",

In this paper, we explore a variation of neural language models that can learn on concepts taken from structured ontologies and extracted from free-text, rather than directly from terms in free-text.This model is employed for the task of measuring semantic similarity between medical concepts, a task that is central to a number of techniques in medical informatics and information retrieval. The model is built with two medical corpora (journal abstracts and patient records) and empirically validated on two ground-truth datasets of human-judged concept pairs assessed by medical professionals. Empirically, our approach correlates closely with expert human assessors (‚âà0.9) and outperforms a number of state-of-the-art benchmarks for medical semantic similarity.The demonstrated superiority of this model for providing an effective semantic similarity measure is promising in that this may translate into effectiveness gains for techniques in medical information retrieval and medical informatics (e.g., query expansion and literature-based discovery).},

abstract = {Crowdsourcing services, such as Amazon Mechanical Turk, allow for easy distribution of small tasks to a large number of workers. Unfortunately, since manually verifying the quality of the submitted results is hard, malicious workers often take advantage of the verification difficulty and submit answers of low quality. Currently, most requesters rely on redundancy to identify the correct answers. However, redundancy is not a panacea. Massive redundancy is expensive, increasing significantly the cost of crowdsourced solutions. Therefore, we need techniques that will accurately estimate the quality of the workers, allowing for the rejection and blocking of the low-performing workers and spammers.However, existing techniques cannot separate the true (unrecoverable) error rate from the (recoverable) biases that some workers exhibit. This lack of separation leads to incorrect assessments of a worker's quality. We present algorithms that improve the existing state-of-the-art techniques, enabling the separation of bias and error. Our algorithm generates a scalar score representing the inherent quality of each worker. We illustrate how to incorporate cost-sensitive classification errors in the overall framework and how to seamlessly integrate unsupervised and supervised techniques for inferring the quality of the workers. We present experimental results demonstrating the performance of the proposed algorithm under a variety of settings.},

isbn = {9781450366748},
publisher = {Association for Computing Machinery},
abstract = {Incorporating knowledge graph (KG) into recommender system is promising in improving the recommendation accuracy and explainability. However, existing methods largely assume that a KG is complete and simply transfer the ‚Äùknowledge‚Äù in KG at the shallow level of entity raw data or embeddings. This may lead to suboptimal performance, since a practical KG can hardly be complete, and it is common that a KG has missing facts, relations, and entities. Thus, we argue that it is crucial to consider the incomplete nature of KG when incorporating it into recommender system. In this paper, we jointly learn the model of recommendation and knowledge graph completion. Distinct from previous KG-based recommendation methods, we transfer the relation information in KG, so as to understand the reasons that a user likes an item. As an example, if a user has watched several movies directed by (relation) the same person (entity), we can infer that the director relation plays a critical role when the user makes the decision, thus help to understand the user's preference at a finer granularity. Technically, we contribute a new translation-based recommendation model, which specially accounts for various preferences in translating a user to an item, and then jointly train it with a KG completion model by combining several transfer schemes. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art KG-based recommendation methods. Further analysis verifies the positive effect of joint training on both tasks of recommendation and KG completion, and the advantage of our model in understanding user preference. We publish our project at https://github.com/TaoMiner/joint-kg-recommender.},

With the rapid growth of biomedical literature‚Äîabout two articles are added every minute on average‚Äîfinding and retrieving the most relevant papers for a given query is increasingly challenging. We present Best Match, a new relevance search algorithm for PubMed that leverages the intelligence of our users and cutting-edge machine-learning technology as an alternative to the traditional date sort order. The Best Match algorithm is trained with past user searches with dozens of relevance-ranking signals (factors), the most important being the past usage of an article, publication date, relevance score, and type of article. This new algorithm demonstrates state-of-the-art retrieval performance in benchmarking experiments as well as an improved user experience in real-world testing (over 20\% increase in user click-through rate). Since its deployment in June 2017, we have observed a significant increase (60\%) in PubMed searches with relevance sort order: it now assists millions of PubMed searches each week. In this work, we hope to increase the awareness and transparency of this new relevance sort option for PubMed users, enabling them to retrieve information more effectively.},

For the problem of making session-based recommendations, i.e., for recommending the next item in an anonymous session, Hidasi et al.~recently investigated the application of recurrent neural networks with Gated Recurrent Units (GRU4REC). Assessing the true effectiveness of such novel approaches based only on what is reported in the literature is however difficult when no standard evaluation protocols are applied and when the strength of the baselines used in the performance comparison is not clear. In this work we show based on a comprehensive empirical evaluation that a heuristics-based nearest neighbor (kNN) scheme for sessions outperforms GRU4REC in the large majority of the tested configurations and datasets. Neighborhood sampling and efficient in-memory data structures ensure the scalability of the kNN method. The best results in the end were often achieved when we combine the kNN approach with GRU4REC, which shows that RNNs can leverage sequential signals in the data that cannot be detected by the co-occurrence-based kNN method.},

abstract = {Internet is changing the world, adapting to the trend of internet sales will bring revenue to traditional insurance companies. Online insurance is still in its early stages of development, where cold start problem (prospective customer) is one of the greatest challenges. In traditional e-commerce field, several cross-domain recommendation (CDR) methods have been studied to infer preferences of cold start users based on their preferences in other domains. However, these CDR methods couldn't be applied to insurance domain directly due to the domain's specific properties. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called a Heterogeneous information network based Cross Domain Insurance Recommendation (HCDIR) system for cold start users. Specifically, we first try to learn more effective user and item latent features in both source and target domains. In source domain, we employ gated recurrent unit (GRU) to module users' dynamic interests. In target domain, given the complexity of insurance products and the data sparsity problem, we construct an insurance heterogeneous information network (IHIN) based on data from PingAn Jinguanjia, the IHIN connects users, agents, insurance products and insurance product properties together, giving us richer information. Then we employ three-level (relational, node, and semantic) attention aggregations to get user and insurance product representations. After obtaining latent features of overlapping users, a feature mapping between the two domains is learned by multi-layer perceptron (MLP). We apply HCDIR on Jinguanjia dataset, and show HCDIR significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions.},

abstract = {Stock prediction aims to predict the future trends of a stock in order to help investors make good investment decisions. Traditional solutions for stock prediction are based on time-series models. With the recent success of deep neural networks in modeling sequential data, deep learning has become a promising choice for stock prediction.However, most existing deep learning solutions are not optimized toward the target of investment, i.e., selecting the best stock with the highest expected revenue. Specifically, they typically formulate stock prediction as a classification (to predict stock trends) or a regression problem (to predict stock prices). More importantly, they largely treat the stocks as independent of each other. The valuable signal in the rich relations between stocks (or companies), such as two stocks are in the same sector and two companies have a supplier-customer relation, is not considered.In this work, we contribute a new deep learning solution, named Relational Stock Ranking (RSR), for stock prediction. Our RSR method advances existing solutions in two major aspects: (1) tailoring the deep learning models for stock ranking, and (2) capturing the stock relations in a time-sensitive manner. The key novelty of our work is the proposal of a new component in neural network modeling, named Temporal Graph Convolution, which jointly models the temporal evolution and relation network of stocks. To validate our method, we perform back-testing on the historical data of two stock markets, NYSE and NASDAQ. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our RSR method. It outperforms state-of-the-art stock prediction solutions achieving an average return ratio of 98\% and 71\% on NYSE and NASDAQ, respectively.},

The two tasks are associated by crosscompress units, which automatically share latent features and learn high-order interactions between items in recommender systems and entities in the knowledge graph. We prove that crosscompress units have sufficient capability of polynomial approximation, and show that MKR is a generalized framework over several representative methods of recommender systems and multi-task learning. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that MKR achieves substantial gains in movie, book, music, and news recommendation, over state-of-the-art baselines. MKR is also shown to be able to maintain satisfactory performance even if user-item interactions are sparse.},

Despite this challenge, the study and development of recommendation systems, based on the authors' collaboration network, productivity and area of research, as topics of interest, have not been practically deployed in healthcare organizations. To address this known practice gap and to promote collaboration, Schosy was developed. This system collects publication metadata from PubMed, as the data source, and combining Collaborative and ContentBased Filtering techniques coupled with the Latent Dirichlet Allocation Topic Modeling algorithm, it recommends collaborators based on the authors' work, collaboration among the authors, Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms and the productivity of relevant researchers. As a result, this system provides an interpretable latent structure for collaborators and biomedical databases in order to enhance the experience of finding collaboration, for and by researchers and non-technical users.},

abstract="Background: It is of great importance for researchers to publish research results in high-quality journals. However, it is often challenging to choose the most suitable publication venue, given the exponential growth of journals and conferences. Although recommender systems have achieved success in promoting movies, music, and products, very few studies have explored recommendation of publication venues, especially for biomedical research. No recommender system exists that can specifically recommend journals in PubMed, the largest collection of biomedical literature. Objective: We aimed to propose a publication recommender system, named Pubmender, to suggest suitable PubMed journals based on a paper's abstract. Methods: In Pubmender, pretrained word2vec was first used to construct the start-up feature space. Subsequently, a deep convolutional neural network was constructed to achieve a high-level representation of abstracts, and a fully connected softmax model was adopted to recommend the best journals. Results: We collected 880,165 papers from 1130 journals in PubMed Central and extracted abstracts from these papers as an empirical dataset. We compared different recommendation models such as Cavnar-Trenkle on the Microsoft Academic Search (MAS) engine, a collaborative filtering--based recommender system for the digital library of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and CiteSeer. We found the accuracy of our system for the top 10 recommendations to be 87.0{\%}, 22.9{\%}, and 196.0{\%} higher than that of MAS, ACM, and CiteSeer, respectively. In addition, we compared our system with Journal Finder and Journal Suggester, which are tools of Elsevier and Springer, respectively, that help authors find suitable journals in their series. The results revealed that the accuracy of our system was 329{\%} higher than that of Journal Finder and 406{\%} higher than that of Journal Suggester for the top 10 recommendations. Our web service is freely available at https://www.keaml.cn:8081/. Conclusions: Our deep learning--based recommender system can suggest an appropriate journal list to help biomedical scientists and clinicians choose suitable venues for their papers. ",

Objective: The aims of this study are to identify off-label drugs that may have benefits for the coronavirus disease pandemic, present a novel ranking algorithm called CovidX to recommend existing drugs for potential repurposing, and validate the literature-based outcome with drug knowledge available in clinical trials. Methods: To achieve such objectives, we applied natural language processing techniques to identify drugs and linked entities (eg, disease, gene, protein, chemical compounds). When such entities are linked, they form a map that can be further explored using network science tools. The CovidX algorithm was based upon a notion that we called ``diversity.'' A diversity score for a given drug was calculated by measuring how ``diverse'' a drug is calculated using various biological entities (regardless of the cardinality of actual instances in each category). The algorithm validates the ranking and awards those drugs that are currently being investigated in open clinical trials. The rationale behind the open clinical trial is to provide a validating mechanism of the PubMed results. This ensures providing up to date evidence of the fast development of this disease. Results: From the analyzed biomedical literature, the algorithm identified 30 possible drug candidates for repurposing, ranked them accordingly, and validated the ranking outcomes against evidence from clinical trials. The top 10 candidates according to our algorithm are hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, chloroquine, ritonavir, losartan, remdesivir, favipiravir, methylprednisolone, rapamycin, and tilorone dihydrochloride. Conclusions: The ranking shows both consistency and promise in identifying drugs that can be repurposed. We believe, however, the full treatment to be a multifaceted, adjuvant approach where multiple drugs may need to be taken at the same time. ",

abstract = "Objective
The centrality of data to biomedical research is difficult to understate, and the same is true for the importance of the biomedical literature in disseminating empirical findings to scientific questions made on such data. But the connections between the literature and related datasets are often weak, hampering the ability of scientists to easily move between existing datasets and existing findings to derive new scientific hypotheses. This work aims to recommend relevant literature articles for datasets with the ultimate goal of increasing the productivity of researchers. Our approach to literature recommendation for datasets is a part of the dataset reusability platform developed at the University Texas Health Science Center at Houston for datasets related to gene expression. This platform incorporates datasets from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). An average of 34 datasets were added to GEO daily in the last five years (i.e. 2014 to 2018), demonstrating the need for automatic methods to connect these datasets with relevant literature. The relevant literature for a given dataset may describe that dataset, provide a scientific finding based on that dataset, or even describe prior and related work to the dataset‚Äôs topic that is of interest to users of the dataset.
Materials and methods
We adopt an information retrieval paradigm for literature recommendation. In our experiments, distributional semantic features are created from the title and abstract of MEDLINE articles. Then, related articles are identified for datasets in GEO. We evaluate multiple distributional methods such as TF-IDF, BM25, Latent Semantic Analysis, Latent Dirichlet Allocation, word2vec, and doc2vec. Top similar papers are recommended for each dataset using cosine similarity between the dataset‚Äôs vector representation and every paper‚Äôs vector representation. We also propose several novel re-ranking and normalization methods over embeddings to improve the recommendations.
Results
The top-performing literature recommendation technique achieved a strict precision at 10 of 0.8333 and a partial precision at 10 of 0.9000 using BM25 based on a manual evaluation of 36 datasets. Evaluation on a larger, automatically-collected benchmark shows small but consistent gains by emphasizing the similarity of dataset and article titles.
Conclusion
This work is the first step toward developing a literature recommendation tool by recommending relevant literature for datasets. This will hopefully lead to better data reuse experience."

In this paper, we first evaluate current extraction methods, including vanilla neural networks, general language models and pre-trained contextualized language models on biomedical information extraction tasks, including named entity recognition, relation extraction and event extraction. We then propose to enrich a contextualized language model by integrating a large scale of biomedical knowledge graphs (namely, BioKGLM). In order to effectively encode knowledge, we explore a three-stage training procedure and introduce different fusion strategies to facilitate knowledge injection. Experimental results on multiple tasks show that BioKGLM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art extraction models.

However, there are many possible intentions a system may have in generating explanations for a given recommendation -from increasing transparency, to enabling a faster decision, to persuading the recipient. As a good explanation for one goal may not be good for others, we address the questions of (1) how to robustly measure if an explanation meets a given goal and (2) how the different goals interact with each other. Specifically, this paper presents a first proposal of how to measure the quality of explanations along seven common goal dimensions catalogued in the literature. We find that the seven goals are not independent, but rather exhibit strong structure. Proposing two novel explanation evaluation designs, we identify challenges in evaluation, and provide more efficient measurement approaches of explanation quality.},

abstract = {Recommender system (RS) devotes to predicting user preference to a given item and has been widely deployed in most web-scale applications. Recently, knowledge graph (KG) attracts much attention in RS due to its abundant connective information. Existing methods either explore independent meta-paths for user-item pairs over KG, or employ graph neural network (GNN) on whole KG to produce representations for users and items separately. Despite effectiveness, the former type of methods fails to fully capture structural information implied in KG, while the latter ignores the mutual effect between target user and item during the embedding propagation. In this work, we propose a new framework named Adaptive Target-Behavior Relational Graph network (ATBRG for short) to effectively capture structural relations of target user-item pairs over KG. Specifically, to associate the given target item with user behaviors over KG, we propose the graph connect and graph prune techniques to construct adaptive target-behavior relational graph. To fully distill structural information from the sub-graph connected by rich relations in an end-to-end fashion, we elaborate on the model design of ATBRG, equipped with relation-aware extractor layer and representation activation layer. We perform extensive experiments on both industrial and benchmark datasets. Empirical results show that ATBRG consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, ATBRG has also achieved a performance improvement of 5.1\% on CTR metric after successful deployment in one popular recommendation scenario of Taobao APP.},

These problems are exacerbated by the document- (rather than sentence-) level annotation common in biological text. In response, we propose a model which simultaneously predicts relationships between all mention pairs in a document. We form pairwise predictions over entire paper abstracts using an efficient self-attention encoder. All-pairs mention scores allow us to perform multi-instance learning by aggregating over mentions to form entity pair representations. We further adapt to settings without mention-level annotation by jointly training to predict named entities and adding a corpus of weakly labeled data. In experiments on two Biocreative benchmark datasets, we achieve state of the art performance on the Biocreative V Chemical Disease Relation dataset for models without external KB resources. We also introduce a new dataset an order of magnitude larger than existing human-annotated biological information extraction datasets and more accurate than distantly supervised alternatives.",

abstract = {Question answering over knowledge graph (QA-KG) aims to use facts in the knowledge graph (KG) to answer natural language questions. It helps end users more efficiently and more easily access the substantial and valuable knowledge in the KG, without knowing its data structures. QA-KG is a nontrivial problem since capturing the semantic meaning of natural language is difficult for a machine. Meanwhile, many knowledge graph embedding methods have been proposed. The key idea is to represent each predicate/entity as a low-dimensional vector, such that the relation information in the KG could be preserved. The learned vectors could benefit various applications such as KG completion and recommender systems. In this paper, we explore to use them to handle the QA-KG problem. However, this remains a challenging task since a predicate could be expressed in different ways in natural language questions. Also, the ambiguity of entity names and partial names makes the number of possible answers large. To bridge the gap, we propose an effective Knowledge Embedding based Question Answering (KEQA) framework. We focus on answering the most common types of questions, i.e., simple questions, in which each question could be answered by the machine straightforwardly if its single head entity and single predicate are correctly identified. To answer a simple question, instead of inferring its head entity and predicate directly, KEQA targets at jointly recovering the question's head entity, predicate, and tail entity representations in the KG embedding spaces. Based on a carefully-designed joint distance metric, the three learned vectors' closest fact in the KG is returned as the answer. Experiments on a widely-adopted benchmark demonstrate that the proposed KEQA outperforms the state-of-the-art QA-KG methods.},

Structured query languages, such as SPARQL, offer a powerful expression ability to query RDF datasets. However, they are difficult to use. Keywords are simple but have a very limited expression ability. Natural language question (NLQ) is promising on querying knowledge graphs. A huge challenge is how to understand the question clearly so as to translate the unstructured question into a structured query. In this paper, we present a data + oracle approach to answer NLQs over knowledge graphs. We let users verify the ambiguities during the query understanding. To reduce the interaction cost, we formalize an interaction problem and design an efficient strategy to solve the problem. We also propose a query prefetch technique by exploiting the latency in the interactions with users. Extensive experiments over the QALD dataset demonstrate that our proposed approach is effective as it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both precision and recall.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of embedding entities and relationships of multi-relational data in low-dimensional vector spaces. Our objective is to propose a canonical model which is easy to train, contains a reduced number of parameters and can scale up to very large databases. Hence, we propose TransE, a method which models relationships by interpreting them as translations operating on the low-dimensional embeddings of the entities. Despite its simplicity, this assumption proves to be powerful since extensive experiments show that TransE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in link prediction on two knowledge bases. Besides, it can be successfully trained on a large scale data set with 1M entities, 25k relationships and more than 17M training samples.},

title = {Knowledge Graph Embedding by Translating on Hyperplanes},
year = {2014},
publisher = {AAAI Press},
abstract = {We deal with embedding a large scale knowledge graph composed of entities and relations into a continuous vector space. TransE is a promising method proposed recently, which is very efficient while achieving state-of-the-art predictive performance. We discuss some mapping properties of relations which should be considered in embedding, such as reflexive, one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many. We note that TransE does not do well in dealing with these properties. Some complex models are capable of preserving these mapping properties but sacrifice efficiency in the process. To make a good trade-off between model capacity and efficiency, in this paper we propose TransH which models a relation as a hyperplane together with a translation operation on it. In this way, we can well preserve the above mapping properties of relations with almost the same model complexity of TransE. Additionally, as a practical knowledge graph is often far from completed, how to construct negative examples to reduce false negative labels in training is very important. Utilizing the one-to-many/many-to-one mapping property of a relation, we propose a simple trick to reduce the possibility of false negative labeling. We conduct extensive experiments on link prediction, triplet classification and fact extraction on benchmark datasets like WordNet and Freebase. Experiments show TransH delivers significant improvements over TransE on predictive accuracy with comparable capability to scale up.},

abstract = {In most real-world scenarios, the ultimate goal of recommender system applications is to suggest a short ranked list of items, namely top-N recommendations, that will appeal to the end user. Often, the problem of computing top-N recommendations is mainly tackled with a two-step approach. The system focuses first on predicting the unknown ratings, which are eventually used to generate a ranked recommendation list. Actually, the top-N recommendation task can be directly seen as a ranking problem where the main goal is not to accurately predict ratings but to directly find the best-ranked list of items to recommend. In this article we present SPrank, a novel hybrid recommendation algorithm able to compute top-N recommendations exploiting freely available knowledge in the Web of Data. In particular, we employ DBpedia, a well-known encyclopedic knowledge base in the Linked Open Data cloud, to extract semantic path-based features and to eventually compute top-N recommendations in a learning-to-rank fashion. Experiments with three datasets related to different domains (books, music, and movies) prove the effectiveness of our approach compared to state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms.},

However, they are inappropriate for the biomedical domain due to numerous overlapping relations in biomedical text. To alleviate the problem, we propose a neural network-based joint learning approach for biomedical entity and relation extraction. In this approach, a novel tagging scheme that takes into account overlapping relations is proposed. Then the Att-BiLSTM-CRF model is built to jointly extract the entities and their relations with our extraction rules. Moreover, the contextualized ELMo representations pre-trained on biomedical text are used to further improve the performance. Experimental results on biomedical corpora show that our method can significantly improve the performance of overlapping relation extraction and achieves the state-of-the-art performance.},

abstract = {AI is remarkably successful and outperforms human experts in certain tasks, even in complex domains such as medicine. Humans on the other hand are experts at multi-modal thinking and can embed new inputs almost instantly into a conceptual knowledge space shaped by experience. In many fields the aim is to build systems capable of explaining themselves, engaging in interactive what-if questions. Such questions, called counterfactuals, are becoming important in the rising field of explainable AI (xAI). Our central hypothesis is that using conceptual knowledge as a guiding model of reality will help to train more explainable, more robust and less biased machine learning models, ideally able to learn from fewer data. One important aspect in the medical domain is that various modalities contribute to one single result. Our main question is ‚ÄúHow can we construct a multi-modal feature representation space (spanning images, text, genomics data) using knowledge bases as an initial connector for the development of novel explanation interface techniques?‚Äù. In this paper we argue for using Graph Neural Networks as a method-of-choice, enabling information fusion for multi-modal causability (causability ‚Äì not to confuse with causality ‚Äì is the measurable extent to which an explanation to a human expert achieves a specified level of causal understanding). The aim of this paper is to motivate the international xAI community to further work into the fields of multi-modal embeddings and interactive explainability, to lay the foundations for effective future human‚ÄìAI interfaces. We emphasize that Graph Neural Networks play a major role for multi-modal causability, since causal links between features can be defined directly using graph structures.}

For this purpose, we propose an assemble-on-demand pre-training toolkit, namely Universal Encoder Representations (UER). UER is loosely coupled, and encapsulated with rich modules. By assembling modules on demand, users can either reproduce a state-of-the-art pre-training model or develop a pre-training model that remains unexplored. With UER, we have built a model zoo, which contains pre-trained models based on different corpora, encoders, and targets (objectives). With proper pre-trained models, we could achieve new state-of-the-art results on a range of downstream datasets.",

Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5 (7.7 point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7{\%} (4.6{\%} absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).",

In this paper we conceptualize extractive summarization as a sentence ranking task and propose a novel training algorithm which globally optimizes the ROUGE evaluation metric through a reinforcement learning objective. We use our algorithm to train a neural summarization model on the CNN and DailyMail datasets and demonstrate experimentally that it outperforms state-of-the-art extractive and abstractive systems when evaluated automatically and by humans.",

CORD-19 is designed to facilitate the development of text mining and information retrieval systems over its rich collection of metadata and structured full text papers. Since its release, CORD-19 has been downloaded over 200K times and has served as the basis of many COVID-19 text mining and discovery systems. In this article, we describe the mechanics of dataset construction, highlighting challenges and key design decisions, provide an overview of how CORD-19 has been used, and describe several shared tasks built around the dataset. We hope this resource will continue to bring together the computing community, biomedical experts, and policy makers in the search for effective treatments and management policies for COVID-19.",

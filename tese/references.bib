abstract="Recent studies have proposed deep learning techniques, namely recurrent neural networks, to improve biomedical text mining tasks. However, these techniques rarely take advantage of existing domain-specific resources, such as ontologies. In Life and Health Sciences there is a vast and valuable set of such resources publicly available, which are continuously being updated. Biomedical ontologies are nowadays a mainstream approach to formalize existing knowledge about entities, such as genes, chemicals, phenotypes, and disorders. These resources contain supplementary information that may not be yet encoded in training data, particularly in domains with limited labeled data.",

All content is freely available and can be accessed online at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi. In this update paper, we describe recent improvements and additions to the ChEBI offering. We have substantially extended our collection of endogenous metabolites for several organisms including human, mouse, Escherichia coli and yeast. Our front-end has also been reworked and updated, improving the user experience, removing our dependency on Java applets in favour of embedded JavaScript components and moving from a monthly release update to a ‘live’ website. Programmatic access has been improved by the introduction of a library, libChEBI, in Java, Python and Matlab. Furthermore, we have added two new tools, namely an analysis tool, BiNChE, and a query tool for the ontology, OntoQuery.}",

Considering most published biological studies elaborated on signal transduction pathways or genetic regulatory information in the form of figure captions, the extraction of miRNA from both the main content and figure captions of a manuscript is useful in aggregate analysis and comparative analysis of the studies published. In this study, we present a statistical principle-based miRNA recognition and normalization method to identify miRNAs and link them to the identifiers in the Rfam database. As one of the core components in the text mining pipeline of the database miRTarBase, the proposed method combined the advantages of previous works relying on pattern, dictionary and supervised learning and provided an integrated solution for the problem of miRNA identification. Furthermore, the knowledge learned from the training data was organized in a human-interpretable manner to understand the reason why the system considers a span of text as a miRNA mention, and the represented knowledge can be further complemented by domain experts. We studied the ambiguity level of miRNA nomenclature to connect the miRNA mentions to the Rfam database and evaluated the performance of our approach on two datasets: the BioCreative VI Bio-ID corpus and the miRNA interaction corpus by extending the later corpus with additional Rfam normalization information. Our study highlights and also proposes a better understanding of the challenges associated with miRNA identification and normalization in scientific literature and the research gap that needs to be further explored in prospective studies.}",

abstract = "The simultaneous administration of multiple drugs increases the probability of interaction among them, as one drug may affect the activities of others. This interaction among drugs may have a positive or negative impact on the therapeutic outcomes. Thus, identification of unknown drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is of significant concern for improving the safety and efficacy of drug consumption. Although multiple DDI resources exist, it is becoming infeasible to maintain these up-to-date manually with the number of biomedical texts growing at a fast pace. Most existing methods model DDI extraction as a classification problem and rely mainly on handcrafted features, and certain features further depend on domain-specific tools. Recently, neural network models using latent features have been demonstrated to yield similar or superior performance compared to existing models. In this study, we present three long short-term memory (LSTM) network models, namely B-LSTM, AB-LSTM, and Joint AB-LSTM. All three models use word and position embedding as latent features; thus, they do not rely on explicit feature engineering. Furthermore, the use of a bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) network allows for extraction of implicit features from an entire sentence. The two models AB-LSTM and Joint AB-LSTM also apply attentive pooling in the Bi-LSTM layer output in order to assign weights to features. Our experimental results on the SemEval-2013 DDI extraction dataset indicate that the Joint AB-LSTM model produces reasonable performance (F-score: 69.39\%) even with the simple architecture."

Therefore, the CRB1 gene is a key target in the fight against blindness. A proof-of-concept for an adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated CRB2 gene augmentation therapy for CRB1-RP was recently described. Preclinical studies using animal models such as knockout or mutant mice are crucial to obtain such proof-of-concept. In this chapter we describe a technique to deliver AAV vectors, into the murine retinas, via the subretinalSubretinalroute. We also present protocols to detect expression of the therapeutic protein by fluorescence immunohistochemistryImmunohistochemistryand to perform histological studies using ultra-thin sections stained with toluidine blue. These techniques in combination with electroretinography and visual behavior tests are in principle sufficient to obtain proof-of-concept for new gene therapies.",

The system performs three sub-tasks: concept extraction, assertion classification, and relation identification.Design The overall system consists of five steps: (1) pre-processing sentences, (2) marking noun phrases (NPs) and adjective phrases (APs), (3) extracting concepts that use a dosage-unit dictionary to dynamically switch two models based on Conditional Random Fields (CRF), (4) classifying assertions based on voting of five classifiers, and (5) identifying relations using normalized sentences with a set of effective discriminating features.Measurements Macro-averaged and micro-averaged precision, recall and F-measure were used to evaluate results.Results The performance is competitive with the state-of-the-art systems with micro-averaged F-measure of 0.8489 for concept extraction, 0.9392 for assertion classification and 0.7326 for relation identification.Conclusions The system exploits an array of common features and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Prudent feature engineering sets the foundation of our systems. In concept extraction, we demonstrated that switching models, one of which is especially designed for telegraphic sentences, improved extraction of the treatment concept significantly. In assertion classification, a set of features derived from a rule-based classifier were proven to be effective for the classes such as conditional and possible. These classes would suffer from data scarcity in conventional machine-learning methods. In relation identification, we use two-staged architecture, the second of which applies pairwise classifiers to possible candidate classes. This architecture significantly improves performance.}",

In a sister paper, we described how to generate English expression patterns related to protein–protein interactions, and this approach alone has already achieved precision and recall rates significantly higher than those of other automatic systems. This paper continues to present our theory, focusing on how to improve the patterns. A minimum description length (MDL)-based pattern-optimization algorithm is designed to reduce and merge patterns.

Accurate prediction of transcriptional regulatory networks is critical in providing useful information for biologists to determine what to do next. Currently, there is a substantial amount of fragmented gene regulation information described in the medical literature. However, current related text analysis methods designed to identify protein–protein interactions are not entirely suitable for finding transcriptional regulatory networks.Result: In this article, we propose an automatic regulatory network inference method that uses bootstrapping of description patterns to predict the relationship between a TF and its TGenes. The proposed method differs from other regulatory network generators in that it makes use of both positive and negative patterns for different vector combinations in a sentence. Moreover, the positive pattern learning process can be fully automatic. Furthermore, patterns for active and passive voice sentences are learned separately. The experiments use 609 HIF-1 expert-tagged articles from PubMed as the gold standard. The results show that the proposed method can automatically generate a predicted regulatory network for a transcription factor. Our system achieves an F-measure of 72.60\\\%.Availability: The software, training/test datasets and learned patterns are available at http://140.116.99.138/∼hcw0901/PubMedSearch.phpContact:seantsai@mail.ncku.edu.twSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",

Since automatic functional annotations of genes are quite useful for interpreting large amounts of high-throughput data efficiently, the demand for automatic extraction of information related to gene functions from text has been increasing.Results: We have developed a method for automatically extracting the biological process functions of genes/protein/families based on Gene Ontology (GO) from text using a shallow parser and sentence structure analysis techniques. When the gene/protein/family names and their functions are described in ACTOR (doer of action) and OBJECT (receiver of action) relationships, the corresponding GO-IDs are assigned to the genes/proteins/families. The gene/protein/family names are recognized using the gene/protein/family name dictionaries developed by our group. To achieve wide recognition of the gene/protein/family functions, we semi-automatically gather functional terms based on GO using co-occurrence, collocation similarities and rule-based techniques. A preliminary experiment demonstrated that our method has an estimated recall of 54–64\\\% with a precision of 91–94\\\% for actually described functions in abstracts. When applied to the PUBMED, it extracted over 190 000 gene–GO relationships and 150 000 family–GO relationships for major eukaryotes.Availability: The extracted gene functions are available at http://prime.ontology.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jpContact:akoike@hgc.jp}",

This study aims to give a clear definition that will differentiate ANN and graphical networks by referring to biological neural networks.

Then differences between ANNs and other networks will be explained by examples using proposed definition."

Our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art on six text classification tasks, reducing the error by 18-24{\%} on the majority of datasets. Furthermore, with only 100 labeled examples, it matches the performance of training from scratch on 100 times more data. We open-source our pretrained models and code.",

Typical methods formulate an input as a \textit{document graph}, integrating various intra-sentential and inter-sentential dependencies. The current state-of-the-art method splits the input graph into two DAGs, adopting a DAG-structured LSTM for each. Though being able to model rich linguistic knowledge by leveraging graph edges, important information can be lost in the splitting procedure. We propose a graph-state LSTM model, which uses a parallel state to model each word, recurrently enriching state values via message passing. Compared with DAG LSTMs, our graph LSTM keeps the original graph structure, and speeds up computation by allowing more parallelization. On a standard benchmark, our model shows the best result in the literature.",

Recent NLP inroads in high-value domains have sparked interest in the more general setting of extracting n-ary relations that span multiple sentences. In this paper, we explore a general relation extraction framework based on graph long short-term memory networks (graph LSTMs) that can be easily extended to cross-sentence n-ary relation extraction. The graph formulation provides a unified way of exploring different LSTM approaches and incorporating various intra-sentential and inter-sentential dependencies, such as sequential, syntactic, and discourse relations. A robust contextual representation is learned for the entities, which serves as input to the relation classifier. This simplifies handling of relations with arbitrary arity, and enables multi-task learning with related relations. We evaluate this framework in two important precision medicine settings, demonstrating its effectiveness with both conventional supervised learning and distant supervision. Cross-sentence extraction produced larger knowledge bases. and multi-task learning significantly improved extraction accuracy. A thorough analysis of various LSTM approaches yielded useful insight the impact of linguistic analysis on extraction accuracy.",

abstract="Nowadays, online data shows an astonishing increase and the issue of semantic indexing remains an open question. Ontologies and knowledge bases have been widely used to optimize performance. However, researchers are placing increased emphasis on internal relations of ontologies but neglect latent semantic relations between ontologies and documents. They generally annotate instances mentioned in documents, which are related to concepts in ontologies. In this paper, we propose an Ontology-based Latent Semantic Indexing approach utilizing Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM-OLSI). We utilize an importance-aware topic model to extract document-level semantic features and leverage ontologies to extract word-level contextual features. Then we encode the above two levels of features and match their embedding vectors utilizing LSTM networks. Finally, the experimental results reveal that LSTM-OLSI outperforms existing techniques and demonstrates deep comprehension of instances and articles.",

Analyzing them yields insight into the structure of society, language, and different patterns of communication. Many approaches have been proposed to perform the analysis. Recently, methods which use the representation of graph nodes in vector space have gained traction from the research community. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive and structured analysis of various graph embedding techniques proposed in the literature. We first introduce the embedding task and its challenges such as scalability, choice of dimensionality, and features to be preserved, and their possible solutions. We then present three categories of approaches based on factorization methods, random walks, and deep learning, with examples of representative algorithms in each category and analysis of their performance on various tasks. We evaluate these state-of-the-art methods on a few common datasets and compare their performance against one another. Our analysis concludes by suggesting some potential applications and future directions. We finally present the open-source Python library we developed, named GEM (Graph Embedding Methods, available at https://github.com/palash1992/GEM), which provides all presented algorithms within a unified interface to foster and facilitate research on the topic."

We use the new, context-sensitive embeddings in a model for predicting prepositional phrase (PP) attachments and jointly learn the concept embeddings and model parameters.

abstract="Several recent works on relation extraction have been applying the distant supervision paradigm: instead of relying on annotated text to learn how to predict relations, they employ existing knowledge bases (KBs) as source of supervision. Crucially, these approaches are trained based on the assumption that each sentence which mentions the two related entities is an expression of the given relation. Here we argue that this leads to noisy patterns that hurt precision, in particular if the knowledge base is not directly related to the text we are working with. We present a novel approach to distant supervision that can alleviate this problem based on the following two ideas: First, we use a factor graph to explicitly model the decision whether two entities are related, and the decision whether this relation is mentioned in a given sentence; second, we apply constraint-driven semi-supervision to train this model without any knowledge about which sentences express the relations in our training KB. We apply our approach to extract relations from the New York Times corpus and use Freebase as knowledge base. When compared to a state-of-the-art approach for relation extraction under distant supervision, we achieve 31{\%} error reduction.",

Despite this fact, there is a lack of comparative studies that shed light into the characteristics and behavior of the different methods. In this work we provide such an analysis focused on the classification task (i.e., leaving out other learning tasks such as regression). In order to perform our study, we implemented fourteen methods grouped into three different families. We analyze the performance of the approaches across a variety of well-known databases, and we also study their behavior in synthetic scenarios in order to highlight their characteristics. As a result of this analysis, we conclude that methods that extract global bag-level information show a clearly superior performance in general. In this sense, the analysis permits us to understand why some types of methods are more successful than others, and it permits us to establish guidelines in the design of new MIL methods."
